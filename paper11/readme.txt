"./TXT Data/TXT Data for Tables 2 and 3/Training data & Testing data.txt": It records the triaing data and testing/prediction data in high-performance prediction and in low-performance prediction. The testing/prediction data in high-performance prediction is used for Tables 2 and 3 in the paper. 



"./TXT Data/TXT Data for Table 1/": It includes 6 files, which record the triaing data and testing/prediction data using different number of filters and activation function. The testing/prediction data corresponding to different number of filters and activation function is used for Table 1 in the paper. 



"./XLSX Data/": It includes 8 files, which record the maximum and average gradient for four different AR sample of different level in high-performance prediction and in low-performance prediction, respectively. The data in these files are used for Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c) in the paper. 




Figure A.pdf: It presents learning curves showing the training loss and validating loss with the respect to the number of epochs for the six different binary CNN models in high-performace prediction, according to the file of "./TXT Data/TXT Data for Tables 2 and 3/Traing data & Testing data.txt".


Figure B.pdf: It shows the confusion matrices in high-performace prediction, according to the file of "./TXT Data/TXT Data for Tables 2 and 3/Traing data & Testing data.txt". 


Figure C: It includes 8 files: Figures C1-C4 and C5-C8 give detailed results of feature visualization for high-performance prediction and low-performance prediction, respectively, which are used for Figure 2(a) in the paper.
