"./TXT Data/TXT Data for Figure 2 and Tables 2 and 3/Training data & Testing data.txt": It records the triaing data and testing/prediction data in high-performance prediction and in low-performance prediction. The training and validating data in high-performance model is used for Figure 2 in the paper. The testing/prediction data in high-performance prediction is used for Tables 2 and 3 in the paper. In addition, the testing/prediction data in high-performance prediction is used for the confusion matrices of Figure 3 in the paper. 



"./CSV Data/gradient_median/": It includes 8 files, which record the median gradient for 10 different AR samples of four different level in high-performance prediction and in low-performance prediction, respectively. The data in these files are used for Figure A1(a) and Figure A1(b) in the paper. 


"./CSV Data/intensity_median/": It includes 8 files, which record the median intensity for 10 different AR samples of four different level in high-performance prediction and in low-performance prediction, respectively. The data in these files are used for Figure A1(c) and Figure A1(d) in the paper. 


"./CSV Data/intensity_total/": It includes 8 files, which record the total intensity for 10 different AR samples of four different level in high-performance prediction and in low-performance prediction, respectively. The data in these files are used for Figure A1(e) and Figure A1(f) in the paper. 


"./CSV Data/Max_Min/": It includes 8 files, which record the difference between the maximum and the minimum in the last convolutional feature map for 10 different AR samples of four different level in high-performance prediction and in low-performance prediction, respectively. The data in these files are used for Figure A1(g) and Figure A1(h) in the paper. 


Figure C: It includes 8 files: Figures C1-C4 and C5-C8 give detailed results of feature visualization for high-performance prediction and low-performance prediction, respectively.
